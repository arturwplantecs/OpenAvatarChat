## Overview

### Introduction

Open Avatar Chat is a modular implementation of interactive digital human conversation, capable of running full features on a single PC. It currently supports MiniCPM-o as a multimodal language model or can replace the typical ASR + LLM + TTS functions using cloud APIs. The structure of these two modes is shown in the diagram below.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/data_flow.svg" />
</p>

### Requirements
* Python version 3.10+
* CUDA-enabled GPU
* The unquantized multimodal language model MiniCPM-o requires more than 20GB of VRAM.
* The digital human component uses the CPU for inference, with a tested device CPU of i9-13980HX, capable of reaching 30FPS.

> [!TIP]
> 
> Using the int4 quantized version of the language model can run on graphics cards with less than 10GB of VRAM, but quantization may affect the performance.
> 
> Replacing MiniCPM-o with cloud APIs to implement the typical ASR + LLM + TTS functions can greatly reduce configuration requirements. For more details, see [ASR + LLM + TTS Mode](#asr--llm--tts-replace-local-minicpm-o).

### Performance
In our tests, using a PC equipped with an i9-13900KF processor and Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, we recorded the response delay. After ten tests, the average delay was about 2.2 seconds. The delay time is the interval from the end of the user's speech to the start of the digital human's speech, including RTC two-way data transmission time, VAD (Voice Activity Detection) stop delay, and the entire process computation time.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Submodules and dependent models in this project require the git LFS module. Please ensure that the LFS functionality is installed:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install git-lfs
> git lfs install 
> ```
> This project references third-party libraries via git submodules, so you need to update submodules before running:
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```
> 
> If you encounter any issues, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/HumanAIGC-Engineering/OpenAvatarChat/issues) to us.



### Download model
Most models and resource files in this project are included in the referenced submodules. The multimodal language model still needs to be downloaded by the user. This project currently uses MiniCPM-o-2.6 as the multimodal language model to provide dialogue capabilities for the digital human. Users can download the relevant model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-o-2_6) or [Modelscope](https://modelscope.cn/models/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o-2_6) as needed. It is recommended to download the model directly to \<ProjectRoot\>/models/. The default configuration's model path points to this location. If placed elsewhere, you need to modify the configuration file. 

There are corresponding scripts for downloading the model in the scripts directory, available for use in a Linux environment. Run the script in the project root directory:

```bash
scripts/download_MiniCPM-o_2.6.sh
```
```bash
scripts/download_MiniCPM-o_2.6-int4.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Both full precision version and the int4 quantized one are supported. HoweverÔºåthe int4 version need a special version of AutoGPTQ to load, refer to the [model card](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-o-2_6-int4) please.

### Prepare ssl certificates
Since we use rtc to stream the video and audio, if not linked from localhost an ssl certificates is needed, user can put exist ones into the ssl_certs folder and config them in the config file or create a new self signed one with the provided script. Run the script under project root to put the result into proper position.
```bash
scripts/create_ssl_certs.sh
```

### Run the demo
The project defaults to using MiniCPM-o as the multimodal language model, which can be started in a Linux container or directly.
  * Run in container: After prepared GPU capable docker environment, run the following script to build and start the service.
    ```bash
    build_and_run.sh
    ```
  * Run directly:
    * Install requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * Start demo
    ```bash
    python src/demo.py
    ```

### TURN Server
If you encounter a continuous waiting state after clicking "Start Conversation", it may be due to NAT traversal issues in your deployment environment (such as deployment on cloud machines). In this case, data relay is required. On Linux systems, you can use coturn to set up a TURN server. Follow these steps to install, start, and configure coturn on the same machine:

* Run the installation script
```console
$ chmod 777 scripts/setup_coturn.sh
# scripts/setup_coturn.sh
```
* Modify the config file, add the following configuration and start the service
```yaml
default:
  service:
    rtc_config:
      # Use the following configuration when using turnserver
      urls: ["turn:your-turn-server.com:3478", "turns:your-turn-server.com:5349"]
      username: "your-username"
      credential: "your-credential"
```
* Ensure that the firewall (including cloud machine security group policies) opens the ports required by coturn

### ASR + LLM + TTS Mode
MiniCPM-o's local startup requirements are relatively high. If you already have an LLM API key, you can start this way to experience the conversational digital human. After making the modifications, you can still use `python src/demo.py` to start.

1. Modify the LLM_Bailian configuration in `config/llm_openai_compatible.yaml`. The call method in the code uses the standard OpenAI approach, which should be compatible in theory.

```yaml
LLM_Bailian: 
  model_name: "qwen-plus"
  system_prompt: "You are an AI digital human. Respond to my questions briefly and insert punctuation where appropriate."
  api_url: 'https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1'
  api_key: 'yourapikey' # default=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY")
```

2. Modify the startup configuration to use: ```python src/demo.py --config config/llm_openai_compatible.yaml```

> [!Note]
> * Internal Code Calling Method
> ```python
> client = OpenAI(
>       api_key= self.api_key, 
>       base_url=self.api_url,
>   )
> completion = client.chat.completions.create(
>     model=self.model_name,
>     messages=[
>        self.system_prompt,
>         {'role': 'user', 'content': chat_text}
>     ],
>     stream=True
>     )
> ```
> - Defaults:
>   - ASR defaults to FunASR using `iic/SenseVoiceSmall`.
>   - LLM defaults to Bailian API URL + API key.
>   - TTS defaults to CosyVoice's `iic/CosyVoice-300M-SFT` + `Chinese Female`. You can modify it to other models and use `ref_audio_path` and `ref_audio_text` for voice cloning.



### Configuration
